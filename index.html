        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! My name is Nahla, I am a first year Computer Programming & Analysis Student at Humber Polytechnic. I actually got a Business Diploma from Seneca Polytechnic in 2023, but I struggled for a while after graduating, as I felt lost when it came to deciding what I wanted to do career-wise. After some time, I started developing quite a new & exciting interest in web development, which was funny for me because I never thought I would be the type of person to be into anything related to computers, let alone coding! By the end of 2024, I made the decision to fully take on an academic career in computer programming, as well as start pursuing my professional career in it. 
            Although I have been into computer programming for some time now, I would still consider myself a total beginner, as I am not that advanced in the self-taught phase of things. So far, I have worked on a few projects in algorithms, database design, computer operating systems, and some web programming & development.
            When it comes to who I am outside of coding, I like to spend my time baking, cooking, reading, developing recipes, and creating social media content that mainly revolves around those hobbies of mine. 
            I guess my favorite things to do in my free time is baking and coding!
