                <div class="about-content">
                    <p>Hello! My name is Nahla, I am a first year Computer Programming & Analysis Student at Humber Polytechnic. I actually got a Business Diploma from Seneca Polytechnic in 2023, but I struggled for a while after graduating, as I felt lost when it came to deciding what I wanted to do career-wise.</p>
                    <p>After some time, I started developing quite a new & exciting interest in web development, which was funny for me because I never thought I would be the type of person to be into anything related to computers, let alone coding! By the end of 2024, I made the decision to fully take on an academic career in computer programming, as well as start pursuing my professional career in it.</p>
                    <p>Although I have been into computer programming for some time now, I would still consider myself a total beginner, as I am not that advanced in the self-taught phase of things. So far, I have worked on a few projects in algorithms, database design, computer operating systems, and some web programming & development.</p>
                    <p>When it comes to who I am outside of coding, I like to spend my time baking, cooking, reading, developing recipes, and creating social media content that mainly revolves around those hobbies of mine.</p>
                    <p class="highlight">I guess my favorite things to do in my free time is baking and coding!</p>
